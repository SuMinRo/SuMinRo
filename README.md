Hi!

My name is Filip, and I am currently an almost finished Computer Science student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden.
I'm specialised in Computer Graphics and Visualisation, but there are few things CS I don't seem to enjoy working with.

I do fun projects during my free time, when my studies isn't consuming all of my otherwise available time.
